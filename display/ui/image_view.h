     * The ImageView can render a bitmap image on the display. It needs a image
     * data source, that delivers the actual bitmap. (See @ref BMPImage)
     *
     * You provide the image data and a bounding rect where the ImageView is
     * painted.
     *
     * If you wish to use the class @ref BMPImage as a image source, you must
     * initialize the SD Card Filesystem first!
     *
     * ## Example
     * @code
     * // init the SD card before accessing the file system
     *
     * // Open and prepare the BMP file to display
     * mono::media::BMPImage img("/sd/my_pic.bmp");
     *
     * // create the view and provide the image source
     * mono::ui::ImageView imgView(&img);
     *
     * // tell the image to be showed
     * imgView.show();
     * @endcode
     *
     * It is your responsibility to make sure the source image data object is 
     * staying around, and do not get deallocated. Preferreably you should make
     * both the image source and the view class members.
     *
     * ## Cropping
     *
     * The image view can crop the source image, thereby only showing a selected
     * portion. The default crop is defined by the views bounding rect. Naturally
     * images larger than the view's rect will be cropped with repect to the
     * upper left corner.
     *
     * The default cropping @ref Rect is therefore *(0, 0, imageWidth, imageHeight)*
     *
     * @brief Displays a bitmap image on the display
