    /**
     * The DisplayPainter draws shapes on a display, using the
     * DisplayController interface.
     *
     * You should use this class to draw shapes on the screen, and use it
     * from inside view only. The standard view class has a reference to
     * to an instance of this class.
     *
     * The coordinate system used by the painter is the same as used by the 
     * display interface. This means all shape coords are relative to the display
     * origo at the top left corner for the screen, when screen is in portrait 
     * mode.
     *
     * A painter keeps track of an active foreground and background color. You
     * can set new colors at any time, and the succeeding draw calls will paint 
     * in that color. The standard draw color is the active foreground color,
     * but some draw routines might use the background color also. An example
     * is the font drawing routines.
     *
     * Like colors, the painter object keeps a active line width and textsize.
     * When drawing shapes based on lines @ref drawLine, @ref drawPolygon,
     * @ref drawRect and @ref drawEllipse, the line width used is the currently
     * active line width property of the painter object.
     *
     * When painting text characters the character size is dependend on the 
     * textsize property. Text painting is not affected by the current line width.
