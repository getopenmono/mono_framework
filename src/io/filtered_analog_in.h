     * @brief A low pass filtered analog input pin.
     *
     * This is a class built upon the standard 
     * [mbed::AnalogIn](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/AnalogIn)
     * class, that include running average low pass filtering.
     *
     * ## Filtered analog inputs
     *
     * In almost all cases you should low pass filter an incoming analog signal,
     * to remove high frequency noise. This class is a convenient way to do
     * that. It uses the @ref RunningAverageFilter to filter all incoming samples.
     *
     * Just like the @ref RunningAverageFilter, this class is templated with the
     * length of the low pass filter.
     *
     * ## Example
     *
     * Here we create 32 sample long filter, attached to the 3.5mm jack connector
     * input pin:
     *
     * @code
     * FilteredAnalogIn<32> input(J_RING1);
     * uint16_t filteredSample = input.rea_u16();
     *Â @endcode
     *
     * @see RunningAverageFilter
