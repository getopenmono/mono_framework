     * after the runtime initalization.
     *
     * You do this from inside the `main()` function. Your main function should
     * look like this:
     *
     * ``
     * int main()

     * Your mono applications entry point must be your own subclass of 
     * IApplication. And you _must_ initalize it inside (not outside)
     * the `main()` function. This is strictly nessesary, because the
     * @ref IApplicationContext must be ready when the IApplication is executed.
     *
     * Also you must call the @ref enterRunLoop method from main, to enter the
     * event loop and prevent `main()` from returning.
