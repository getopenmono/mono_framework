    /**
     * @brief Generic abstract interface for the power management system
     *
     * A PowerManagement implementation class handles power related events and
     * sets up the system. The ApplicationContext object initializes an instance
     * of this class automatically. Use can find a pointer to the PowerManagement
     * object in the static @ref IApplicationContext class.
     *
     * Depending on the system (mono device or simulator), the concrete sub-class
     * implementation of this interface varies.
     *
     * The active @ref IApplicationContext initializes this class and calls its
     * POR initialization functions. Implementations of this class then calls 
     * and initializes any nessasary related classes, like the power supply IC
     * sub-system (@ref IPowerSubSystem).
     *
     * This interface defines queues of objects that implement the @ref
     * IPowerAware interface. This interface lets classes handle critical
     * power events like:
     *
     * * **Power-On-Reset** (POR): Called when the chip powers up after a reset
     * * **Enter Sleep Mode**: Called before system goes in to low power sleep mode
     * * **Awake From Sleep**: Called when nornal mode is restored after sleep
     *
     * #### Power Awareness Queue
     * Classes that handle components like I2C, Display, etc can use the PowerAware
     * interface to receive these type of events. Its the PowerManagement object
     * task to call these @ref IPowerAware objects.
     * 
     * The interface defines a protected member object @ref powerAwarenessQueue
     * that is a pointer to the first object in the queue. The Power Awareness
     * Queue is a list of objects that implment the @ref IpowerAware interface
     * and have added themselves to the queue by calling @ref AppendToPowerAwareQueue
     *
     * Objects in the queue receive power aware notifications on event like 
     * enter sleep mode, wake from sleep and battery low. You can add your own
     * objects to the queue to make them "power aware" or you remove the system
     * components that gets added by default. (But why would you do that?)
