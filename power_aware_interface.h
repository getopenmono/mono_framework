     * Classes that implements this interface canreceive power related events in
     * from of handler methods. This interface define the 3 handler methods:
     *
     * 1. `@ref onSystemPowerOnReset` : Called reset or first power on
     * 2. `@ref onSystemEnterSleep` : Called just before system enter sleep mode
     * 3. `@ref onSystemWakeFromSleep` : Called right after the system has woken from sleep
     * 4. `@ref OnSystemBatteryLow` : Called when battery is critically low
     *
     * Inheriting this interface is not enough to active the functionality. You
     * must remember to add your object instance to the @ref IPowerManagement 
     * instance, that can be obtained from the static  @ref IApplicationContext
     * class.
