    /**
     * @brief A queued Timer class, recurring or single shot.
     *
     * A timer can call a function at regular intervals or after a defined delay.
     * You can use the timer to do periodic tasks, like house-keeping functions
     * or display updates.
     *
     * ### Queued callback
     *
     * The timer uses the Application Run Loop to schedule the callback handler 
     * function. This means your callback are not executed inside a hardware
     * interrupt context. This is very convenient since your can do any kind of
     * heavy lifting in your callback handler, and your code is not pre-empted.
     *
     * ### Presicion
     *
     * You should note that the timer are not guaranteed to be precisely accurate,
     * it might fire later than your defined interval (or delay). The timer will
     * not fire before your defined interval though.
     * If you use any blocking `wait` statements in your code, you might contribute
     * to loss in precision for timers.
     *
     * If you want precise hardware timer interrupts consider the mbed Ticker 
     * class, but you should be aware of the hazards when using hardware interrupts.
     *
     * ### Example
     *
     * Create a reocurring timer that fires each second:
     * @code
     * Timer timr(1000);
     * timr.attach<MyClass>(this, &MyClass::callback);
     * timr.Start();
     * @endcode
     *
     * The member function `callback` will now be called every second.
     * If you want to use a single shot callback with a delay, Timer has a
     * convenience static function:
     * @code
     * Timer delay = Timer::callOnce<MyClass>(100, this, &MyClass::callback);
     * @endcode
     *
     * Now `delay` is a running timer that calls `callback` only one time. *Note*
     * that the timer object (`delay`) should not be deallocated. Deallocating 
     * the object will cause the timer to shut down.
     *
     * ### Time slices
     *
     * Say you set an interval of 1000 ms, and your callback takes 300 ms to 
     * execute. Then timer will delay for 700 ms and not 1000 ms. It is up to you
     * to ensure your callback do not take longer to execute, than the timer
     * interval.
